\begin{rSection}{Professional Objective}
  I'm looking for a position as a software developer in a company with an
  open and informal environment. This company must aim for technical excellence,
  continuous improvement and no fear of error.

  I \underline{love} to study computing and I am also a highly technical person.
  Hence, I'm looking for a position that enables one to face highly complex
  technical challenges.

\begin{rSection}{Professional Experience}
  \begin{rSubsection}{Locaweb}{June 2014 - Today}{Software Engineer}{São
      Paulo, Brazil}

  \item At Locaweb, I work at the 'hosting and platform' (PaaS) team. I am
    currently leading the project of the new hosting platform which is a
    re-implementation of the whole system that provisions and handles the
    life cycle of all the hosting plans. The aim of this project is to replace
    the current legacy system. Locaweb is latin america's leader in the hosting
    market.

  \item The main programming language used is Ruby. The environment is highly
    heterogeneous, with a wide range of technologies, both old and new, such as
    Windows, Linux, C\#, Ruby, PHP, Perl and ASP pages. I'm responsible for the
    core provisioning backend, which is comprised of complex dependency
    resolution logic and highly concurrent background job execution. Although
    the main part of the work is re-implementing the legacy system, from time to
    time we are faced with critical bugs in production. I also work diagnosing
    and fixing them.

  \item In my team, we are happy to work with a mix of Agile methodologies such
    as XP, Scrum and Kanban. We apply {\em TDD}, {\em pair programming},
    continuous integration, {\em code-review/pull-requests} and various other
    practices. Of course, we use Git.

  \begin{rSubsection}{Chemtech Software \& Engineering Services}{January 2012 -
      April 2014}{System's Engineer}{São Paulo, Brazil}

  \item After being third place in the ``Chemtech's National Engineering
    Marathon'' I was invited to work with Chemtech's engineering team.

  \item I have worked with {\em process autoation} and {\em Industrial IT},
    developing and maintaining mission critical systems for the process
    Industry. There, most of the work I done was in the Microsoft stack (Windows
    Server, Sql Server, C\#, F\#, ASP.Net MVC).

  \item For one and a half year, I was responsible for the maintenance of the
    control system of one of the largest automated refrigerated warehouses in
    Brazil. There, I had to work with various levels of abstraction, from binary
    automation machinery protocols to complex logistical rules and ensuring
    inventory optimization.

  \item Also, leveraging my engineering degree, I responsible for the creation
    of a project automation group, dedicated to automate many tasks of the
    industrial engineering branch of the company. I needed to cooperate with
    various engineering disciplines, collect requirements and implement many
    small applications that gave them a significant productivity boost. Those
    applications ranged from automatic revision of drawings in AutoCAD to
    synchronizing engineering information in various kinds of documents.

\begin{rSection}{Technical Knowledge}
  Most of my professional experience is in the Ruby/Linux and .Net/Windows
  ecosystems. I have deep understanding of both object oriented and functional
  programming.

  I'm an Emacs power-user, and I have contributed to many open-source
  projects in Emacs-Lisp.

  I have also completed many courses in the EDx and Coursera platforms, all
  100\% in English. Some of the courses I took were:

    $\cdot$ Programming languages & Coursera/University Of Washington \\
    $\cdot$ Software as a service & EDx/UC Berkley \\

\begin{rSection}{Complementary Academic Experience}
  {\bf Undergraduate Research} \hfill {\em March 2009 - November 2012} \\
  I worked with algorithms for advanced process control. I was an integrant of a
  research group with a high interest in the practical application of such
  algorithms in physical chemical systems. During the period of this work, I had
  much contact with computational mathematics. I developed many applications and
  libraries in the Fortran95, Matlab, Scilab and Tcl programming languages. I
  had scholarships during the whole period of this work.

  {\bf Integrated Graduate Program (PIF) Unicamp} \hfill {\em January 2012 -
    December 2012} \\
  The Integrated Graduate Program allows the student with outstanding
  performance to take graduate classes during the senior year. I took all the
  necessary classes of the Master's degree program in Chemical systems
  engineering. Between those classes, I'd like to emphasize the following:

  \begin{tabular}{ @{} l @{\hspace{6ex}} l }
    $\cdot$ Automation of chemical systems & 36 hours \\
    $\cdot$ Artificial intelligence applied to process control  & 30 hours \\
    $\cdot$ Computational methods applied to engineering & 60 hours \\
    $\cdot$ Linear control (electrical engineering's master degree course) & 60 hours \\
