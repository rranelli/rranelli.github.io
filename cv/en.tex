\begin{rSection}{Professional Objective}
  I'm looking for a position as a senior software developer.

  I \underline{love} to study software engineering and I am also a highly
  technical person. Hence, I'm looking for a position that enables one to face
  complex technical challenges and exercise good software development practices.

\begin{rSection}{Professional Experience}
  \begin{rSubsection}{Telnyx}{\em April 2018 - Today}{Senior Software Engineer}{Chicago, EUA}

  \item Telnyx is a Chicago based, next-generation realtime communications
    platform that bring the 21st century to telecomunications. At Telnyx I'm
    responsible for one of the most critical services in the company, written
    entirely in Elixir. I was also responsible for rewriting numerous Python and
    Ruby projects into Elixir in order to achieve better performance and
    reliability.

    Everything we do at Telnyx is very latency sensitive, so I was required to
    architect and develop solutions that take that while still maintaining a
    high level of availablility.

    Also, Telnyx is a remote-first company and most of its engineering team
    works remotely from all across the world. I'm currently working remotely
    from São Paulo but I do go to Chicago every three months.

  \begin{rSubsection}{QuintoAndar}{\em September 2017 - March 2018}{Senior Software Engineer}{São
      Paulo, Brazil}

  \item QuintoAndar is a real-estate startup in Brazil. There I had the
    opportunity to work and a fast-growing environment with 8+ development
    squads. There, I mainly worked with Python, Javascript and Clojure.
  \end{rSubsection}

  \begin{rSubsection}{Xerpa}{\em November 2015 - August 2017}{Senior Software Engineer}{São
      Paulo, Brazil}

  \item At Xerpa I had the pleasure of working with Elixir full time for almost
    two years. I was the third software engineer there and acted on every part
    of the product, from infrastructure automation to front-end development.

  \item I have contributed in every part of the company. I leveraged my
    professional network and brought half of the engineering team, while also
    helping with interviews, product roadmap definition and customer support. It
    was, for sure, my most rewarding and deep professional experience to date.
  \end{rSubsection}

  \begin{rSubsection}{Locaweb}{\em June 2014 - October 2015}{Software Engineer}{São
      Paulo, Brazil}

  \item At Locaweb, I worked at the 'hosting and platform' (PaaS) team. I lead
    the new hosting platform project which is a `big-scary-rewrite` of a 20 year
    legacy system.

  \item The main programming language used was Ruby, but the environment was
    highly heterogeneous, with technologies such as Windows, Linux, C\#, Ruby,
    PHP, Perl, Python and ASP pages. I was responsible for the core provisioning
    backend, which was comprised of complex dependency resolution logic and
    highly concurrent background job execution.

  \begin{rSubsection}{Chemtech Software \& Engineering Services}{\em January 2012 -
      April 2014}{System's Engineer}{São Paulo, Brazil}

  \item After being third place in the ``Chemtech's National Engineering
    Marathon'' I was invited to work with Chemtech's engineering team.

  \item I have worked with {\em process autmoation} and {\em Industrial IT},
    developing and maintaining mission critical systems for the process
    Industry. There, most of the work I done was in the Microsoft stack (Windows
    Server, Sql Server, C\#, F\#, ASP.Net MVC).

  \item Also, leveraging my engineering degree, I responsible for the creation
    of a project automation group, dedicated to automate many tasks of the
    industrial engineering branch of the company. I needed to cooperate with
    various engineering disciplines, collect requirements and implement many
    small applications that gave them a significant productivity boost.

\begin{rSection}{Technical Knowledge}
  I worked in a variety of environments. I have a deep experience with Elixir,
  Ruby and .Net. I have also worked a bit with Python, Javascript, Haskell,
  Clojure and other languages.

  I'm an Emacs power-user, and I have contributed to many open-source
  projects in Emacs-Lisp.

  I'm a frequent speaker in software development events in Brazil, (more than 50
  talks in the last 3 years). I have also spoken in high-profile Elixir
  conferences in the US, namely ElixirConf (2016 and 2017) and Empex.co (2017).
