* My talk @ DevInSantos2015 -- There is life beyond OOP
</p>

  *TL;DR*: The talk I gave last November @ DevInSantos was just released. See
  the link to the video & slides below

  <p hidden> _excerpt-separator_ </p>

  The title of the talk is "There is life beyond OOP", but it could also have
  been "Why you should care about functional programming". Since there are just
  too many talks with titles similar to the latter I decided to go on with the
  former name.

  In this talk I try to explain why people are talking so much about functional
  programming in the recent years and why this is expected given what is going
  on in the hardware industries since early 2000s. I also try to break some
  misconceptions people tend to get while learning FP and I also show how
  "state" has absolutely nothing to do with "mutability".

  Here are the [[https://speakerdeck.com/rranelli/devinsantos-2015-there-is-life-beyond-oop][slides for the talk]].

  That's it.
