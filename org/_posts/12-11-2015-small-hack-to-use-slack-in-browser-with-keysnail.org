  *TL;DR*: In this (*very*) brief post I describe how you can make your =C-k=
  binding in [[https://github.com/mooz/keysnail][Keysnail]] play nice with [[https://slack.com][Slack]]'s =C-k=.

  <p hidden> _excerpt-separator_ </p>

  If you use [[https://github.com/mooz/keysnail][Keysnail]] you probably have your =C-k= key bound to
  =comand.killLine= to emulate Emacs' default behaviour. The problem is that
  Slack binds =C-k= and =C-t= ^1 to the nice _quick switch bar_ and it gives you
  no way of changing that.

  In order to make Keysnail's =C-k= work when editing text areas and recover the
  default behavior of Slack's =C-k=, I was able to hack this small snippet which
  should be added to your =.keysnail.js= file:

#+begin_src js
// This fixes the issue where `C-k`
// does not work with slack out of global mode
key.setGlobalKey('C-k', function (ev) {
    content
        .window
        .document
        .getElementById("quick_switcher_btn")
        .click();
});
#+end_src

  This event handler will get the =div= with =id= equal to =quick_switcher_btn=
  and issue a =click= event to it, which is the exact element you =click= to
  show the _quick switch bar_:

  [[http://{{ site.url }}/public/slack_quick_switch.png]]

  Ugly, but functional.

  It's the first time in my life where I was able to use Firefox's developer
  tools to do something useful.

  That's it.

  (1) Really?? A default binding to =C-t=? WTF people! Please, think of those
  who do *not* use OSX for a second...
