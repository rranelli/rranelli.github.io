* <p hidden>Missing TCO in Ruby<p hidden>

  *TL;DR*: Do not rely on non-existing TCO.

  I have started the course [[https://www.coursera.org/course/algo][Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1]] from
  [[http://coursera.org][Coursera]] last week. The first programming assignment was to implement the
  counting of inversions in a *big* array of numbers, shuffled from 0 to
  100,000.

  The problem of counting inversions is the following:

  #+begin_quote
  An inversion occurs in the following situation:

  Given an /i/ in the set [ 0, /n-1/ ], if there exists a /j/ in [ /i/ +1, /n-1/
  ] such that *x* [ /i/ ] > *x* [ /j/ ], [ /i/, /j/ ] is an inversion in *x*. The number
  of inversions in /i/ is the number of such /j/'s that satisfy this condition.

  The number of inversions in *x* is the sum of inversions for all /i/ in [ 0,
  /n-1/ ]
  #+end_quote

  The naive approach to solving this problem would be for each /i/ in [0,
  /n/-1], scan the sub-array *x*[/i/../n/-1] and count such inversions. This
  approach would lead to O(nÂ²) execution time.

  A more clever approach would be to piggyback on the merge-sort algorithm to
  count the inversions [reference [[http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counting-inversions/][here]]].

  Since I'm that weird guy that learned functional programming before object
  oriented programming, I've happily implemented the merge algorithm in Ruby in
  the most natural way:

  (The implementation used to actually solve the problem keeps track of the
  inversions while executing the merge sort. I've kept this out of the following
  snippets to simplify my point about the lack of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call][TCO]] in Ruby.)

  #+begin_src ruby
def pretty_merge(left, right, acc = [])
  return (acc + left + right) if left.empty? || right.empty?

  (lhead, *ltail) = left
  (rhead, *rtail) = right

  if lhead <= rhead
    pretty_merge(ltail, right, acc + [lhead])
  else
    pretty_merge(left, rtail, acc + [rhead])
  end
end
  #+end_src

  I even took the care to make the method tail-recursive. To my surprise, when I
  actually ran the algorithm in the full data set:

  #+begin_src sh
$ ./solve.rb
> ~/rralgo007/lib/week1/inversions.rb:54: stack level too deep (SystemStackError)
  #+end_src

  What a shame! In order to fix this, I had to implement the merge step in this
  terrible and ugly way: (actually, the first iteration was way worse than this.
  This ugliness was the best I could achieve)

  #+begin_src ruby
def ugly_merge(left, right)
  result = []

  until left.empty? || right.empty?
    if left.first <= right.first
      (lhead, *left) = left
      result << lhead
    else
      (rhead, *right) = right
      result << rhead
    end
  end

  result + left + right
end
  #+end_src

  I find this much harder to read and reason. Well, you can't win everyday.

  *[EDIT]*: But Wait! Ruby *actually* implements TCO (!), and you can activate it if
  you want to. I have actually used the stuff from [[http://nithinbekal.com/posts/ruby-tco/][this]], [[http://timelessrepo.com/tailin-ruby][this]], [[http://blog.tdg5.com/tail-call-optimization-ruby-deep-dive/][and this]] to solve
  this problem with the _pretty_merge_ version. In the near future I will write
  a post about the process. Stay tuned!
