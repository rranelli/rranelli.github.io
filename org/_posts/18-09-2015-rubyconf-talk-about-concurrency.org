  *TL;DR*: Just finished my talk about Concurrency in Ruby @ Ruby Conf Brazil. I
  was completely terrified when I saw the number of people in the room. Somehow,
  I survived and people seemed to like it.

  Here are the [[https://t.co/erCs8uRPvb][slides for the talk]].

  EDIT: The video has been released [[https://www.eventials.com/locaweb/nao-tema-o-gil-o-que-ruby-tem-em-sua-caixa-para-programacao-concorrente-com-renan-ranelli/][here]]. Too bad you need to login to see it ;/

  That's it.
