# <p hidden>live-coding-a-multithreaded-job-executor<p hidden>

**TL;DR**: Last week I gave a talk (in pt-br) at the local Ruby user group which
is a variation of what I did at Rubyconf Brazil 2015. In this talk I live-code
a thread-pool and a (**very**) simple background job processor emulating some of
Sidekiq's interface.

That's it.
