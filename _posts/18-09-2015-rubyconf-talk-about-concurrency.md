# rubyconf-talk-about-concurrency

</p>

**TL;DR**: Just finished my talk about Concurrency in Ruby @ Ruby Conf Brazil. I
was completely terrified when I saw the number of people in the room. Somehow,
I survived and people seemed to like it.

Here are the [slides for the talk](https://t.co/erCs8uRPvb).

EDIT: The video has been released [here](https://www.eventials.com/locaweb/nao-tema-o-gil-o-que-ruby-tem-em-sua-caixa-para-programacao-concorrente-com-renan-ranelli/). Too bad you need to login to see it ;/

That's it.
