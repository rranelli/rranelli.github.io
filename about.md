My name is Renan Ranelli. I'm a {chemical,software} engineer, Emacs aficionado,
sometimes gamer and permanently nerd.

In this space I will talk about software development and its contrast with
industrial engineering projects (which I had the {dis,}pleasure of working for
two and a half years after graduating). I also talk about the stuff I'm
studying, the stuff I code in Emacs and other brain dumps.

I'm currently developing the next generation HR platform with Elixir & Erlang at
[Xerpa](http://www.xerpa.com.br/), after a long time working with Ruby at [Locaweb](http://www.locaweb.com.br/). I also know Java, Lisp
(Clojure and Emacs lisp), Javascript, a little of Scala, F#, Haskell and a bunch
of C#. I Never touched PHP, and did almost no front-end work. I'm currently
learning [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and I'm loving it!

During college I worked with *advanced process control* in a research group.
There I had the opportunity to program in widely different environments, from
machine programming (Ladder, grafcet, C) to solving high level simulation and
optimization problems with non-trivial mathematical methods in {Mat,Sci}lab and
Octave. I even had to code some of my code in Fortran for raw speed on
number-crunching.

I'm a voracious reader. I keep up with my reading using [goodreads](http://goodreads.com). Here is my
[profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19870807-renan-ranelli) there. My goal this year is to read 16 technical books.

If you're interested can get my CV here. (a version in portuguese is also
available)
