My name is Renan Ranelli. I'm a {chemical,software} engineer, Emacs aficionado,
sometimes gamer and permanently nerd.

In this space I will talk about software development and its contrast with
industrial engineering projects (which I had the {dis,}pleasure of working for
two and a half years after graduating). I also talk about the stuff I'm
studying, the stuff I code in Emacs and other brain dumps.

I'm currently working at [Locaweb](http://www.locaweb.com.br) as a software engineer. I work full-time with
Ruby. I also know Java, Lisp (Clojure and Scheme), Javascript, a little bit of
Scala, F#, Haskell and a bunch of C#. I Never touched PHP, did almost no
front-end workand. Probably the next thing for is learning Rust or Elixir.

During college I worked with *advanced process control* in a research group.
There I had the opportunity to program in widely different environments, from
machine programming (Ladder, grafcet, C) to solving high level simulation and
optimization problems with non-trivial mathematical methods in {Mat,Sci}lab and
Octave. I even had to code some of my code in Fortran for raw speed on
number-crunching.

If you're interested can get my CV here (still in Portuguese only, probably
gonna translate it in the nar future).
